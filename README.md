# GTNH-Guide-Pack

Overview
----
GTNH-Guide-Pack is a documentation and template repository designed for use with GuideNH — a Markdown-driven, in‑game guide framework for Minecraft 1.7.10. This repository supplies GT-New-Horizons–style guide templates, examples, and authoring workflows so contributors can create polished, searchable, in-game documentation that players can read without leaving Minecraft.

GTNH players currently rely on fragmented external resources — the Wiki, Discord, videos, spreadsheets, and scattered forum posts. There is no single in‑game system that presents long‑form documentation, interactive content, searchable recipes, and structured progression in one place. That fragmentation makes discovery and learning harder for new and returning players.

GuideNH is an in‑game guide framework that solves the fragmentation problem by rendering Markdown content inside Minecraft (1.7.10). It is a framework only — documentation content (machines, progression, tutorials) is written by contributors and distributed as resource packs or mod assets.

Key idea and project links:
- Repository: https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GuideNH
- Wiki: https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GuideNH/wiki

Features
----
- Full Markdown rendering (tables, admonitions/alerts, code blocks, lists)
- Custom interactive tags: item links, tooltips, internal and external links
- NEI recipe integration embedded in guide pages (look up recipes without leaving the guide)
- Interactive 3D multiblock previews and model viewers
- Automatic page discovery via standard resource pack locations (no manifest required)
- Native multi-language support with fallback to English
- Live preview and hot‑reload for content authors (fast edit -> test loop)

Quick Start
----
1. Clone this repo and read [getting-started.md](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GuideNH/blob/master/wiki/Getting-Started.md) for the authoring basics and [ContributionGuide.md](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GTNH-Guide-Pack/blob/master/ContributionGuide.md) for contribution guidelines.
2. Write guide pages in Markdown under docs/ following the provided templates.
3. Test locally with GuideNH live preview (see GuideNH repo for preview tool) or package into a resource pack and drop into the client resourcepacks/ directory.
4. Submit content via PR to this repository or another GuideNH-enabled project.

Authoring Conventions
----
- File format: Markdown (UTF-8), begin each page with a top-level H1.
- Keep pages focused: short introduction, clear objectives, prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, tips, and optional troubleshooting.
- Use fenced code blocks for commands or JSON (```bash, ```json).
- Cite sources for recipes and numeric values (mod name + recipe origin).
- Include image alt text and captions for accessibility.

Localization
----
- Place language files under .../_<lang>/ (e.g., en_us.md, zh_cn.md).
- Use the same filename and folder structure across languages; GuideNH loads per‑page translations and falls back to English.
